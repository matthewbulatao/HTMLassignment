<h1> About the Developer </h1>
<p><b> Quote <br/><i> Steve Jobs </i></b> 1995: â€œEverybody should learn to <b><ins><em> program </ins></b></em> a computer, because it teaches you how to think" 1995 was a time when computers already played an important role in our society but weren't as omnipresent in our lives as they are today. </p>

<Big><b>Hi, Good day!</Big></b><br/>
 
My name is <em><strong> Matthew Bulatao </em></strong> who was born and raised in <em><ins> Manila, Philippines.</em></ins> I am currently studying <b> BSIT </b><i><big><strong> (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology)</i></big></strong> at <i><big><strong> UNIVERSITY OF THE EAST, MANILA. </i></big></strong> While growing up, I noticed that the development of technology nowadays is extremely fast and important in the advancement of the industry. Which inspires me to become a Professional System Developer in one of the best technology company someday. 
 
<br/>
<br/>
 
Since my first year in college, <ins> my interest and eagerness to learn programming is growing.</ins>   I always look up on to my brother-in-law who is very good at his job as a system developer. I sometimes asked for his help to deepen and broaden my programming skills. I do have an interest and passion in web designing as well. 
 
<br/>
<br/>
 
Before the pandemic started, I and my friends always meet at the nearby court to play my <ins> favourite sport, basketball.</ins>  But due to the safe distancing restrictions and also to protect myself from the pandemic, I spend most of my free time watching movies and series thru Netflix at home. I am also very good in cooking filipino food which my family loves.
